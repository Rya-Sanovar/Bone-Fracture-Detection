# Bone-Fracture-Detection

In this project, I leveraged deep neural networks for bone fracture detection using X-ray Images deployed on android devices and an FPGA board. Bone fractures can take diverse forms and it necessitates timely and accurate automated diagnosis. To tackle this, I developed a customized deep layered MobileNet model tailored for bone fracture detection. My goal was to build upon prior research, enhancing classification performance of my models. The trained model demonstrated substantial accuracies, specifically 89% testing accuracy. Furthermore, we effectively deployed this custom model as both an Android application and on an FPGA PYNQ-Z2 board after post training quantization, harnessing hardware acceleration to markedly enhance latency performance, with only a marginal compromise on accuracy. Our efforts in this project have the potential to provide valuable support for individuals seeking timely and accurate real-time bone fracture detection.
